## About Dataset

### Context
While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, it was found out that iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

## Introduction
This project aims at performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Google-Playstore-Dataset to draw meaningful inferences and what various typical feature engineeirng techniques can be performed that are ought to be performed before any kind of Machine Learning model-building. The idea behind this analysis was to gain a hands-on practice and experiment various pre-processing techniques by the virtue of this dataset.
